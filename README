Project Description
This is a wonderful implementation of page flipper entirely based on HTML 5 <canvas> tag. It means that it can work in any browser that supports HTML 5 standard draft - just out of the box!

PARTNER NEEDED: It would be nice to have someone else working on this project so if you are familiar with jQuery and are interested in this project - please send me a word.

This project started from a wonderful article by Rick Barraza where he describes all mathematics needed for awesome page flipping: http://bit.ly/1k2Pne
